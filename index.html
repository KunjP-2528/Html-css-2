          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a
          Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
          Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
          Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a
          local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13]
          His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth
          between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam
          was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
          family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders
          and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land.

          Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The
          family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland
          and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims
          between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
          to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
          fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the
          ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was
          born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers t
